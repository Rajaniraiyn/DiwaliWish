## FAQs

### How it Works?

- This simply uses the _**URL parameters**_ API for the Name, Wish and the gif URL.
- The URL parameters are get by `URLSearchParams(window.location.search)`.
- Then they are separated and used appropriately by `get()` method

### Where is my Name?

- If you're in Desktop (devices havig tab name in browsers) you can see `{your name} Wishes You with ❤` as tab name.

### Does it stores what I give?

- **No**, This doesn't store anything but it simply change them into URL.
